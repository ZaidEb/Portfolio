# Portfolio Project

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run this command to install all necessary packages (Tailwind CSS, etc.):
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
This will start the Tailwind CSS watcher and a local web server at the same time:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Other Commands
- **Build CSS manually:** `npm run build`
- **Watch CSS only:** `npm run watch` (if you don't need the local server)
